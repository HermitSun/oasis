          'Data Management across Geographically Distributed Autonomous Systems: Architecture, Implementation, and Performance Evaluation',
        authors: ['Dawei Sun', 'Guangyan Zhang', 'Shang Gao'],
        _abstract:
          'The issue of highly efficient geographically-distributed autonomous data management is one of the critical obstacles for opening up a big data era. It creates the need for investigating autonomous and distributed data management systems in big data environments. In this paper, a distributed autonomous data management system is put forward, exhibiting the following features. (1) A distributed architecture designed to meet the requirements of autonomous data management by allowing interconnection, intercommunication, and interoperation of multiple sites over the Internet. (2) An autonomous, multi-level, unstructured data storage system to meet high-efficiency storage needs, with reference to the distributed heterogeneous data storage theories. (3) A distributed autonomous data indexing and retrieval system to support metadata search & full-text searching, fast loading, remote access, and unified view. Experimental and application results demonstrate that the proposed system has high potential to reduce access time and improve storage efficiency, while maintaining satisfactory availability and scalability.',

        authors: ['Yingjie Zhang', 'Hao Huang'],
        _abstract:
          'There has been an increasing amount of open educational resources (OERs) on the Internet. However, not so many instructors are familiar with those resources, or can easily use them, which leads to insufficient application of these resources in daily teaching. By analyzing the requirements of physical education courses in universities, this paper categorizes the resources for these courses, and proposes the design objectives, technical architecture and main functions of the resource database for physical education courses. We integrate resources of physical education courses from different online sources into a centralized resource database, and link this database to a learning management system so that college instructors and students can get easily access the resources and take advantage of them in personalized instruction and self-learning. Based on the resources in the database, online and offline integrated blended courses are designed and applied preliminarily in the basketball classes in a university in China. The results indicate that the resource database can effectively help instructors develop blended courses, increase the quality of instruction, and substantially improve learning.',

          "Offline handwriting recognition is a well-known challenging task in the optical character recognition (OCR) field due to the difficulty caused by various unconstraint handwriting styles. In order to learn invariant feature representations for handwriting, we propose a novel method to incorporate pixel-level rectification into a CNN and RNN based model. We also propose an adjacent output mixup method for RNN layer's training to improve the generalization ability of the model, i.e., the previous output of an RNN layer is added to the current output with random weights. We additionally adopt a series of techniques including pre-training, data augmentation and language model, and further analyze their contributions to the improvement of the model performance. The proposed method performs well on three public benchmarks, including the IAM, Rimes and IFN/ENIT datasets.",

          "Recommender systems provide insurance enterprises with insights on customer behaviors and demands, thereby serving as an important source of revenue generation. Key success factors for a recommender include incorporation of multi-dimensional data from diverse media, clear and interpretable presentation of analytical results, and accurate recommendation of insurance products. However, most existing methods in the industry produce merely a list of recommendations without effectively visualizing them, and meanwhile are based on correlation-driven algorithms that can omit significant causal patterns in both customer and product data. In this paper, we propose a causation-driven visualization system that fundamentally transforms cross-media insurance data into network diagrams and performs recommendation reasoning. The system leverages data retrieved from both local insurance service providers and resources across the Web, and utilizes a multi-valued confounder balancing algorithm to compute the causal effect between customer and products, aiming to explore the reasons behind customers' purchasing behaviors and make appropriate recommendations accordingly. Furthermore, we conduct domain expert studies to evaluate the effectiveness of knowledge discovery by our causation-driven visualization system and correlation-driven tools currently adopted in the insurance industry. Results show that our system considerably outperforms others in terms of all evaluation metrics, and can potentially help insurers devise practical decision-making strategies.",

          'With increasingly extensive use of blended courses in universities, it has become a popular field of research to study how to collect and analyze behavior data of instructors and students in blended courses and to ultimately enhance learning.

Online teaching and learning behaviors are analyzed using learning analysis models based on learning management systems.

There are two main contributions respectively in deterministic and stochastic modeling perspective. First, we propose a new RNN architecture for modeling the deterministic dynamics, which updates hidden states along a z-order curve to enhance the consistency of the features of mirrored layers. Second, we introduce an adversarial training approach to two-stream Znet for modeling the stochastic variations, which forces the Znet-Predictor to imitate the behavior of the Znet-Probe. This two-stream architecture enables the adversarial training to be conducted in the feature space instead of the image space. Our model achieves the state-of-the-art prediction accuracy on two video datasets.',

We used this framework to implement several important dense tensor kernels. We implemented dense matrix multiply for an Arria-10 FPGA and a research CGRA, achieving 88% and 92% of the performance of manually written, and highly optimized expert (ninja") implementations in just 3% of their engineering time.

          'Ship detection is one important task in radar remote sensing. Moreover, Polarimetry shows a valuable contribution to discriminate between targets and clutter. The performance of most polarimetric detectors depends on two important factors: target clutter ratio (TCR) and speckles (or standard deviation to mean ratio of clutter background). The polarimetric matched filter (PMF) is just to maximize the TCR, while the polarimetric whitening filter (PWF) only takes the speckle reduction into consideration. In this paper, the optimal polarimetric detection filter (OPDF) is put forward, which considers maximizing the ratio of TCR to speckle. The approximate expression of the probability density function (PDF) of the OPDF is derived in closed form, so are the probability of false alarm (PFA) and the probability of detection (PD) in Wishart distribution assumption. The threshold of the OPDF detection can be easily obtained in closed form or via the bisection method. Experiments via simulated data validate the correctness of our results. The OPDF detector gives the best performance in most environments, especially in low PFA case and in the case where the statistics of targets is not the ideal Wishart distribution.',

          'With the explosive growth of Internet traffic, multi-source content delivery has been introduced for improving the performance and quality-of-experience (QoE) of Internet services. Upgrading from single-source content delivery to multi-source content delivery, however, may not always lead to a better performance. Instead, a decline in terms of delivery speed often occurs. By conducting a comprehensive study, we show that the underlying reason of this counter-intuitive phenomenon is actually due to the cask effect of data sources at both macro and micro level. Specifically, at the macro level, data sources with different types are highly heterogeneous in terms of delivery performance, which means data sources with certain types are particularly easy to become the "short boards". At the micro level, for the data sources chosen by a client, the high diversity of participation time (DPT) of the sources could impair the acceleration effect. Motivated by the above findings, we design MDR (Multi-source Delivery Redirector), a middleware that contains two optimizations to improve the acceleration effect. One is the feature-greedy selection algorithm which can avoid selecting data sources with inferior types, and the other is the DPT-driven shuffle strategy which can avoid using unstable data sources. Simulation-based experiments show that the MDR outperforms existing approaches in terms of overall downloading performance.',

          "On ARM processors with TrustZone security extension, asynchronous introspection mechanisms have been developed in the secure world to detect security policy violations in the normal world. These mechanisms provide security protection via passively checking the normal world snapshot. However, since previous secure world checking solutions require to suspend the entire rich OS, asynchronous introspection has not been widely adopted in the real world. Given a multi-core ARM system that can execute the two worlds simultaneously on different cores, secure world introspection can check the rich OS without suspension. However, we identify a new normal-world evasion attack that can defeat the asynchronous introspection by removing the attacking traces in parallel from one core when the security checking is performing on another core. We perform a systematic study on this attack and present its efficiency against existing asynchronous introspection mechanisms. As the countermeasure, we propose a secure and trustworthy asynchronous introspection mechanism called SATIN, which can efficiently detect the evasion attacks by increasing the attackers' evasion time cost and decreasing the defender's execution time under a safe limit. We implement a prototype on an ARM development board and the experimental results show that SATIN can effectively prevent evasion attacks on multi-core systems with a minor system overhead.",
