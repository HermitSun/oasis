It is crucial for the design of update operations and their composition to know which properties they can preserve when they are applied to a program. The author argues in favor of the abstract data type view of programs, and presents a general framework in which different programming languages, update languages, and properties can be studied.",

We address the process of evolution by proposing a primitive-coordination context-for modelling the circumstances in which reconfiguration can and should take place. The idea is for business policies to emerge as properties of process executions when controlled through the coordination contexts that will have been defined for supporting business activities.",

The ADT view of programs goes beyond the approach of syntax-directed editors and proof-editors since it is possible to combine basic update operations into larger update programs that can be stored and reused. It is crucial for the design of update operations and their composition to know which properties they can preserve when they are applied to a program. The author argues in favor of the abstract data type view of programs, and presents a general framework in which different programming languages, update languages, and properties can be studied.",

We address the process of evolution by proposing a primitive-coordination context-for modelling the circumstances in which reconfiguration can and should take place. The idea is for business policies to emerge as properties of process executions when controlled through the coordination contexts that will have been defined for supporting business activities.",

The ADT view of programs goes beyond the approach of syntax-directed editors and proof-editors since it is possible to combine basic update operations into larger update programs that can be stored and reused. It is crucial for the design of update operations and their composition to know which properties they can preserve when they are applied to a program. The author argues in favor of the abstract data type view of programs, and presents a general framework in which different programming languages, update languages, and properties can be studied.",

To overcome this situation we aim at a methodology for an evolutionary formal software development which allows for a stepwise and incremental development process along the line of rapid prototyping. The approach is based on work on a formal management of change for formal developments which is able to maintain proofs when changing specifications.",
